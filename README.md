# About Me
Well, I'm really new to the concept of Github. I've used a repository before (UberSVN), but I'm new to using Git. I come from a designer background, but I have a keen interest in how coding works and have developed some skills in my career. I keep researching more and more and try to retain everything, so that someday (soon, I hope) I can be a full stack developer.
